## We exported cleaned data sets for medicare, medicaid, mortality and population data as csv files into our Project 251 folder. We shall now import the medicare, mortality and population cleaned data sets into the Milestone 3 Rmd file for preparation for further analysis. 

#We have chosen to use the medicare data (65+) to be prepared for merging with mortality and population data.
